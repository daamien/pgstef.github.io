title: PostgreSQL 11 preview - update a partition key
---

In the case of a partitioned table, updating a row might cause it to no
longer satisfy the partition constraint of the containing partition.

There's a recent commit for version 11 modifying PostgreSQL behavior in 
that case.

With PostgreSQL 10, that case threw an error.

For example:

```sql
# CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 int) PARTITION BY RANGE (c1);
# CREATE TABLE t1_part_1 PARTITION OF t1 FOR VALUES FROM (1) to (10);
# CREATE TABLE t1_part_2 PARTITION OF t1 FOR VALUES FROM (10) to (20);
# INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(generate_series(1,9));

# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1_part_1;
 count 
-------
     9
(1 row)

# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1_part_2;
 count 
-------
     0
(1 row)
```

Let's try this simple `UPDATE`:

```sql
v10=# UPDATE t1 SET c1 = c1 + 10;
ERROR:  new row for relation "t1_part_1" violates partition constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (11).
```

Some days ago, there was this new feature added in version 11 which is currently under development:

Allow UPDATE to move rows between partitions.

When an UPDATE causes a row to no longer match the partition
constraint, try to move it to a different partition where it does
match the partition constraint.  In essence, the UPDATE is split into
a DELETE from the old partition and an INSERT into the new one.  This
can lead to surprising behavior in concurrency scenarios because
EvalPlanQual rechecks won't work as they normally did; the known
problems are documented.  (There is a pending patch to improve the
situation further, but it needs more review.)

```

Now, if there is some other partition in the partition tree for which the
row satisfies its partition constraint, then the row is moved to that
partition. If there isn't such a partition, an error will occur. The error
will also occur when updating a partition directly. 

Behind the scenes, the row movement is actually a `DELETE` and `INSERT` operation.

Let's see how the simple example above behave:

```sql
v11=# UPDATE t1 SET c1 = c1 + 10;
UPDATE 9

v11=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1_part_1;
 count 
-------
     0
(1 row)

v11=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1_part_2;
 count 
-------
     9
(1 row)
```

The rows are indeed moved from one partition to another. Nice, isn't it?
